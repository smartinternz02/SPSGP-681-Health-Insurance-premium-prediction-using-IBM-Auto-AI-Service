Health Insurance-premium-prediction  using IBM Auto AI Service:

1.This project builds a web App that automatically estimates premium cost by taking the input values. 

2.Using IBM AutoAI, we automate all of the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements. 

3.Data set includes the age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking preferences, region, and charges to predict the health insurance premium cost that an individual pays.

4.The user creates an IBM Watson Studio Service, IBM Cloud Object Storage Service on IBM Cloud.

5.The user uploads the insurance premium data file into Watson Studio.

6.The user creates an AutoAI Experiment to predict an insurance premium on Watson Studio.

7.AutoAI uses Machine Learning Service to create several models, and the user deploys the best performing model.

8.We use the Node-RED web application to connect to the deployed model and predict an insurance
